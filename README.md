Crosseyed (2022), unfinished autostereogram game

## How this works
To "play", cross your eyes and make the red dots match. You should slowly start seeing a "tetris like game" form, with some squares.

The player is the square at the bottom left corner. Use A and D keys to move around.

There is no point to this game.
